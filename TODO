Important for 0.5.0/capisuite-py:
* Check and fix all 'todo:'s in the python library and scripts.
* Update documentation to include
  - capisuite-checkconfig
  - the python library modules.
  - 'Mail Fax|Voice ...' sections in config files
* Add update instructions for 0.5.0/capisuite-py
  - 'Mail Fax|Voice ...' sections in config files
  - new modulename '_capisuite' (but use capisuite.core instead)
* Add option '--is-configured' to capisuite-checkconfig to be used
  by rc-file.

Build:
* Determine the path of the stylsheets automatically. These are
  currently hardcoded for Suse Linux.

NICE:
- more checks/options for capisuite-checkconfig
- ?valgrind-clean the used libs and Python?
- support more than one send_controller
- don't use 34xx codes, define constants instead and print meaningful messages

FUTURE PLANS:
- setuid away from root (problem: chown of recorded file to user)
- test-implement the whole application part in Python
- rewrite capisuitefax and idle.py to use named socket communication
